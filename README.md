MATLAB Codes for AUT Linear Control Laboratory

This repository contains my codes and detailed reports for the Linear Control Laboratory at Amirkabir University of Technology.
It features four experiments organized under the following headings:
1. Servo Motor - Motor control using PD, Lead & PI compensators
2. Ball & Beam System - Ball position control using PV & Lead controllers
3. Flexible Joint Robot - Robot control using Lag & Lead compensators as well as state feedback method
